# 3D Zipline Simulation in Unity

This repository contains a 3D zipline simulation developed using the Unity game engine. The project demonstrates basic physics-based zipline traversal mechanics.

## Requirements

To open and run this project, **Unity must be installed** on your system. The project was developed using Unity 2022.3, and it is recommended to use the same or a later compatible version to avoid compatibility issues.

You can download Unity from the [official Unity website](https://unity.com/).

## Opening the Project

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Open Unity Hub.
3. Select "Open" and navigate to the folder where this project is located.
4. Unity will load the project. **Note that the first time opening it may take some time** due to import and compilation of assets.

### Important Notes

- On the **first launch**, Unity may appear **stuck or unresponsive**. If this happens, simply **close Unity and reopen the project**. This typically resolves the issue.
- If prompted with a message asking to open the project in **Safe Mode**, please **enter ignore** and proceed normally.

## Project Overview

The simulation includes:
- A 3D environment with a zipline setup
- A character controller that interacts with the zipline
- Basic physics simulation for movement along the zipline
- Trigger zones and visual markers for demonstration purposes

## Presentation

If you do not have Unity installed or encounter issues opening the project, I will provide a **`.exe` build** of the simulation. We can demonstrate the full functionality during the presentation to ensure you can view the project without needing to set up Unity locally.
